# 15-112-Term-Project
Group Wordle

A word-guessing game where 5 players have to guess a randomly generated 5-letter word in one attempt 
by playing 5 individual word-guessing games on instagram

How to run the project:
1) ensure that you have all the required libraries installed. This can be done by running the command "pip install -r requirements.txt" in CMD
2) open the main.py file and type the username and password of the instagram account you will use for the individual games
3) run main.py

IMPORTANT NOTE: THE LOGIN FUNCTION DOES NOT HANDLE CHALLENGES (2FA), SO MAKE SURE THE ACCOUNT YOU ARE USING HAS 2FA DISABLED. it is better if you create a new 
instagram account and use it rather than use an existing instagram account.
ANOTHER NOTE: if you face issues with login due to 2fa, try to login, do the challenge (2fa) on your phone/laptop and login again.
